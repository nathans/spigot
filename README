spigot depends on Python 2.6 or higher and the following non-standard libraries:  

- oauth >= 1.0 from <http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/python/>
- Universal Feed Parser >= 5.0 <http://www.feedparser.org/>
  
To use spigot, invoke it from the command line
> python spigot

It will prompt you to add at least one account and one feed on first run. For more options, run:
> python spigot -h
